If you want notifications when a new task is created or PR is ready to merge, set up the Lancey Slack connector so you can manage the agents from within Slack.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integrations">
    Head to [Integrations](https://platform.lancey.ai/settings/integrations/slack.com) page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connecting Slack">
    Click on the **Slack** connectorÂ 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selecting workspace">
    Complete the login flow that pops up in the Slack domain. Choose **the workspace** that you want to connect to Lancey.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selecting channel" stepNumber={4}>
    Pick the **channel** you want Lancey to send notifications in. Typically this would be #engineering or #engineering-alert type of channel if you use something similar internally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once the connection is set up, you can also connect your personal account to recieve notifications directly from the Lancey bot instead of a channel.

<Note>
  Remember to have your [notification](https://platform.lancey.ai/settings/notifications) preferences enabled for Slack after you've completed the setup.
