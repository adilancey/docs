## Setting up

Lancey lets you spin up multiplayer agents for your engineering team so you can plan and execute code tasks as a team, in the background.

Typically most engineers rely on IDE based copilots that can do a single task at a time, without any visibility across the team.

This  means you're stuck waiting for LLM to complete a single task while not being able to work on anything else.

Lancey lets you 100x your engineering output by letting you parallelize tasks across 100s of agents in background.
