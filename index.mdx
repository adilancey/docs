## What is Lancey?

Lancey lets you spin up multiplayer agents for your engineering team so you can plan and execute code tasks as a team, in the background.

Typically most engineers rely on IDE based copilots that can do a single task at a time, without any visibility across the team.

This  means you're stuck waiting for LLM to complete a single task while not being able to work on anything else.

Lancey lets you 100x your engineering output by letting you parallelize tasks across 100s of agents in background.

## What can I use Lancey for?

- **Scans your customer support channels**— Lancey can listen to incoming support tickets and Github issues your users create and can automatically generate PRs to fix them.
- **Multi-player coding tasks** — Tell Lancey what to work on and it will start tackling tasks in the background. You'll get a full overview across your entire team on what everyone else's agent is working on.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Review and approve all changes before they're merged. Set custom approval workflows and maintain full oversight of your codebase.

## Do I need to change my CI/CD pipeline?

Everything lands where your code already lives.

Lancey integreates deeply with GitHub, Jira, Linear & Slack, automatically linking PRs to tickets and alerting your team. No one on the team has to change their existing workflow.
