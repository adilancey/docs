## What is a task?

A task is a suggested change or bug fix that Lancey generates based on incoming issues or manual input. Each task includes:

- **Context**: The source of the issue (GitHub, Zendesk, Intercom, etc.)
- **Proposed plan**: How Lancey suggests solving the problem
- **Next actions**: Approve, edit, or dismiss the task

## How tasks are created

### 1. From GitHub issues

- When a new issue is opened in your connected GitHub repository, Lancey automatically analyzes it.
- If the issue is deemed to be a bug or feature improvement, a task will be created and linked back to the original GitHub issue.

### 2. From customer support tickets

- Lancey integrates with Zendesk, Intercom, and other platforms.
- High‑impact customer tickets are converted into tasks with relevant context for Lancey to work on.

### 3. Manually created by users

- Go to the **Tasks** tab in your dashboard.
- Give a prompt in the chat input box
- Lancey will plan out a resolution path, including any code changes required.
